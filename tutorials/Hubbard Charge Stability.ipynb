We can pass an optional parameter corresponding to a list of capacitances, which tells us how to convert from occupation in each dot to a current in order to replicate what an experiment might see. This list must be the same length as the number of sites since in general, each site will have a different coupling to a charge sensor. If no capacitances are passed, a unique color will be given to each occupation. However, this color is meaningless, so further analysis of the object cannot be done unless capacitances are passed."
